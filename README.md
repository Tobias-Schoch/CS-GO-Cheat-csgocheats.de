# CS:GO Cheat by Tobias Schoch

## Description
This repository contains the source code for a CS:GO cheat developed. 
It includes features like a skin changer, wallhack, bunny hop, no flash and radar enemy spotting.
The cheat was previously commercial on [csgocheats.de](https://csgocheats.de/) distributed by me.

## Features
- **Bunny Hop**: Automatically jump to maintain speed in-game.
- **No Flash**: Reduces the effect of flashbang grenades.
- **Glow**: Makes players glow for better visibility.
- **Radar Hack**: Shows enemies on the radar.
- **Skin Changer**: Change skins of weapons dynamically in-game.
- **Aim Assistant**: Aim assistant features are not in this repository, because algorithms are used in new commercial Counter-Strike versions
